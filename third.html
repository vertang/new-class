    <h2>JavaScript 란</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
      ECMAScript specification.
      JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
       It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
      Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
       often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

      As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
      It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
      regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM).
